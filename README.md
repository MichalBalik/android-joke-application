# Problem Specification

For my semester project in the subject **Application Development for Mobile Devices**, I created an application that displays user-submitted jokes stored in a database. In addition to viewing added jokes, users have the option to create their own jokes and save them. These saved jokes can be browsed and deleted according to user preferences.

# Implementation Description

The application consists of **five activities**, each containing specific logic for the app's functionality. To create these activities, I used the built-in design tools in **Android Studio**. 

- **Predefined jokes** are stored in an **SQLite database**, which is integrated into Android.
- **User-created jokes** are stored using **serialization** and saved in the device's internal storage.
